          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>I am 42 years old and a Chef by trade. I am currently looking to make the switch to the tech industry either as a web developer, project manager, or software sales executive. With years of diverse leadership experience and a deep passion for technology, I am eager to transition into the software engineering field.</p>

          <p>I recently completed NC State's Web Developer Boot Camp and received my certification in Web Development in January 2023. Additionally, I am certified as a MuleSoft Level 1 Developer. I’m looking forward to the opportunity to leverage my skills and experience in this new, dynamic field.</p>

          <p>While I have found a great deal of fulfillment in the culinary field, the tech industry is my true passion. In 2022, I made the decision to enroll in NC State’s software developer boot camp. Throughout the program, I gained hands-on experience in coding languages such as HTML, JavaScript, Python, CSS, Linux, and React, along with principles of cybersecurity, SQL databases, and data modeling. These skills, paired with my MuleSoft certification, have equipped me with the technical knowledge to thrive in a dynamic software development environment.</p>

          <p>The opportunity to combine my leadership experience with my newly acquired technical skills is incredibly rewarding, and I am looking forward to this journey. In my role as Executive Chef, I cultivate an industry-leading business dining experience, always prioritizing customers while leading a culinary team to produce high-quality, boutique-level food. I have introduced a new marketing strategy for our catering department, organizing monthly expos for administrators and executives, which has led to a 10% year-over-year increase in catering sales. Additionally, I am actively streamlining our Point-of-Sale systems, making them more user-friendly, reducing wait times, and improving customer satisfaction.</p>

          <p>Fun fact: I share my name with Michael Manley, the fourth Prime Minister of Jamaica, who served from 1972–1980 and again from 1989–1992. He is still remembered as one of Jamaica’s most influential leaders.</p>
